Bots can log their data here. It is used by interwiki.py and some bots will
log here if used with the -log parameter.
If you run the bot from e.g. a server (like TS, labs, ...) it could be a good
idea to symlink this directory to your webspace public_html directory, e.g.
"cd public_html; ln -s [path-to]/logs trunk-logs".
